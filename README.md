## Problem

1. When going to Amazon.com, if you search for "HDMI", you will receive 343,000+ results. This can be _very_ overwhelming for users.

2. When it comes to online shopping, everything is scattered, and as a result, you have to search through multiple sites to find what you want - which requires a lot of time and you aren't shown all of the available options matching your search (and you lose out on all of the personalization).

3. The current privacy and security issues that every online shopping site faces.

## Solution

1. We solve this problem by offering the user-friendliest interface and our _filtering system_ to simplify searching and discovering products. 

2. We solve this problem with our _personalization_ mentioned in the 'features' section below.

3. We solve this problem with our _privacy_ and _security_ features mentioned in the 'features' section below.

Essentially, iFiltr saves online shoppers time and money while shopping securely.
